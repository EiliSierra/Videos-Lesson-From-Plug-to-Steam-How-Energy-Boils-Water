# From Plug to Steam: How Energy Boils Water - Video Scripts

Educational video scripts for 8th Grade Physical Science (PS3) using Cell Collective modeling platform.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains professional video scripts and production materials for the educational lesson **"From Plug to Steam: How Energy Boils Water"**. The lesson teaches students about energy systems, energy transfer, and system modeling through hands-on activities using the Cell Collective platform.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Identify key components in a simple energy system
- Show the direction of energy flow between system parts
- Set up simulations that model energy-driven changes
- Test what happens when energy flow is disrupted
- Use simulation results to explain how energy input leads to observable results

### 🎓 Grade Level & Standards

- **Grade:** 8th Grade
- **Subject:** Physical Science
- **Standard:** PS3 (Energy)
- **Platform:** Cell Collective
- **Modeling Approach:** Systems thinking and computational modeling
