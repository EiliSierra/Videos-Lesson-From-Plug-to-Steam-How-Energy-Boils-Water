## PART 1: RECAP & INTRO - REMEMBER WHAT YOU BUILT (30 seconds)

**Scene:** Cell Collective interface showing the completed Activity 1 model

### VOICEOVER:
> "Welcome back! Great job on Activity 1."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Remember what you built? You've got your Energy Input in orange at the outlet, your Heating Coil in the middle, and your Boiling Water at the pot."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Three components. All in the right places. But... do you remember what we said was missing?"
>
> *[Pause - let students think]*
>
> "That's right! The connections! The arrows that show how energy moves from one part to the next."
>
> "Today, we're gonna add those connections. And that's when your system... comes alive."

### VISUALS:
- Show complete Activity 1 model on screen
- Cursor highlights each component as mentioned
- Brief spotlight effect on each component
- Then cursor/animation highlights the empty spaces between components
- Visual question mark or "?" appears briefly in the space between components

**[Energetic transition - music rises]**

## PART 2: THE ENERGY FLOW CONCEPT (30 seconds)

**Scene:** Simple conceptual animation

### VOICEOVER:
> "Here's the key idea: Energy doesn't just sit in one place. It doesn't stay quiet at the outlet or stuck in the coil."
>
> "Energy MOVES. It flows. It travels. And as it moves, it CAUSES things to happen."

### VISUALS:
- Simple animation showing energy concept:
  - Point A (energy source) glows
  - Line/arrow appears connecting to Point B
  - Energy flows along the arrow (animated particles or glow)
  - Point B activates/lights up
  - Cause and effect emphasized

### VOICEOVER:
> "When electrical energy flows TO the heating coil... what happens?"

### VISUALS:
- Arrow from outlet to coil
- Coil heats up, turns red

### VOICEOVER:
> "The coil heats up!"
>
> "And when that heat flows TO the water..."

### VISUALS:
- Arrow from coil to water
- Water bubbles, steam rises

### VOICEOVER:
> "The water starts to boil!"
>
> "Cause... and effect. That's what arrows show us in a model."

### VISUALS:
- Text appears: "Cause → Effect"
- Arrows pulse/highlight

## PART 3: TRANSITION TO CREATING CONNECTIONS (15 seconds)

**Scene:** Cell Collective interface with Activity 1 model

### VOICEOVER:

### VISUALS:
- Cursor points to the orange Energy Input circle
- Orange color emphasized/highlighted

### VOICEOVER:
> "There's a reason for that."
>
> "See, the other two components - Heating Coil and Boiling Water - they're gray. They're INTERNAL. They're part of the system."
>
> "But Energy Input is orange because it comes from OUTSIDE. It's not part of the system... it's what POWERS the system."

### VISUALS:
