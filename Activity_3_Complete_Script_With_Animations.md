## PART 2: ENTERING SIMULATION MODE (45 seconds)

**Scene:** Simulation interface is now visible on screen

### VOICEOVER:
> "Here's the first thing you need to know: there's a big difference between building a model and simulating it."
>
> "Building a model is what you did in Activities 1 and 2. That's the structure. That's the blueprint."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Simulating? That's watching it work. That's turning it on and seeing what happens."

### VISUALS:
- Show the transition from static model to simulation interface
- Simulation controls now visible on screen
- Focus on key elements available

### VOICEOVER:
> "And now... you get a whole new interface. This is where the magic happens."

## PART 4: OBSERVING COMPONENTS - STEP BY STEP (50 seconds)

**Scene:** Simulation interface, focus on Internal Components section

### VISUALS:
- Cursor hovers over eye icon next to Heating Coil
- Icon highlights/glows

### VOICEOVER:
> "So let's say we want to watch what happens to the Heating Coil when energy changes."

### ACTION:
**CLICK on eye icon next to Heating Coil**

### VISUALS:
- Eye icon changes state (opens, shows white/bright)
- Heating Coil becomes "selected for observation"
- Visual confirmation: checkmark or highlight

### VOICEOVER:

>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Now let's also watch Boiling Water. Same thing."

### VISUALS:

### VISUALS:
- Zoom in on Energy Input slider
- Slider is currently at 100%

### VOICEOVER:
> "Right now, Energy Input is at 100%. Full power. Energy is flowing."
>
> "Watch what I do..."

### VISUALS:
- Cursor hovers over slider
- Slider highlights/glows

### VOICEOVER:
> "I'm gonna move this slider... all the way down... to 0%."

### ACTION:
**Drag slider from 100% down to 0% (slow, deliberate movement)**

### VISUALS:
- Slider moves smoothly to the left
- Percentage indicator changes: 100% → 75% → 50% → 25% → 0%
- Energy Input circle might dim or change color
- Dramatic visual feedback showing "OFF"

### VOICEOVER:
> "Energy Input is now at 0%."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "This means the kettle is plugged in... but there's no electricity flowing. Nothing is turned on."

### VISUALS:
- Slider is at 0%
- Energy Input looks "inactive" or "off"
- Text confirmation: "OFF" or "0% Active"

### VOICEOVER:
> "So... with NO energy coming in..."
>
> *[Dramatic pause]*
>
> "What do you think will happen to the Heating Coil?"
>
> *[Pause - let them think]*
>
> "And what about the Boiling Water?"
>
> *[Pause]*
>

## PART 6: IMPORTANT CONCEPT - ENERGY DEPENDENCE (30 seconds)

**Scene:** Conceptual animation or text overlay

### VOICEOVER:
> "Before we hit play, I want you to understand something important."
>
> *[More serious, educational tone]*
>
> "In a system like this, some parts depend on energy to work."

### VISUALS:
- Animation showing:
  - Heating Coil box
  - Arrow pointing TO it from Energy Input
  - Dependency concept illustrated

### VOICEOVER:
> "The Heating Coil? It DEPENDS on Energy Input. If there's no energy... the coil can't heat up."
>
> "The Boiling Water? It depends on the Heating Coil. If the coil isn't hot... the water won't boil."

### VISUALS:
- Chain of dependency shown:
  - Energy Input → (enables) → Heating Coil
  - Heating Coil → (enables) → Boiling Water

### VOICEOVER:
> "So when we turn OFF the energy... everything that depends on it... stops working."
>
> "That's a really important idea in systems. It's called Energy Dependence."

### VISUALS:
- Text appears: "Energy Dependence"
- Definition appears: "When one part of a system needs energy to work"

3. ✅ **Observation Selection**
   - Choose what to watch
   - Which components to track
